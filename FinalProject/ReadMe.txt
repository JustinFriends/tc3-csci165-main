Items currently only (partially) work for the 'Hero' characters, currently just the Mario class.  I'm not sure if the Star item is working (a temporary stat boost that doubles attack, gives invulnerability (+100 defense), and doubles movement, which all effects should last 5 'turns' and the item is 'equipped') fully functional.  I'm not sure if it unequips once its duration runs out (as I couldn't pass the unit test and eventually ran out of time).

For the Mushroom class I wasn't sure how to test the Mushroom item (heals 50 health) completely due to random moving.  When at 50 or less health, the Mario class should either 'use' the Mushroom (if it's within attack range), or move towards it.  The use function works and causes the heal to fire properly.  Well, due to the random movement (1 of 4 possibilities), even if the logic isn't properly firing, it should still assert true 25% of the time because it will have moved towards the Mushroom.  Conversely, when the Mario health is above 50, it should ignore the Mushroom item.  Again, due to the random move, it should still move towards the item 25% of the time regardless of whether it's truly being ignored or not.
